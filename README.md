Network Analysis on WormNet version3 Benchmark dataset through Sparse Matrix Representation
-
This is an Explanatory Data Analysis project I worked on that furthered my understanding in Graph Theory & Sparse Matrices.
I delve into the principles of transforming large and complex networks into efficient representations using sparse matrices. The goal is to enable more scalable and adaptable analysis of networks by converting traditional edge lists into sparse matrix formats. This conversion allows for the handling of large datasets with minimal computational overhead, facilitating deeper insights into network structures, relationships & dynamics. 
The project demonstrates how to apply this approach to domains such as social network analysis, biological systems or infrastructure networks, ensuring a more streamlined and efficient data processing framework for modern network analysis challenges

Further improvements, would include computing PageRank scores for nodes to rank significance within the network.
Calculating eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix to reveal deeper structural properties of the network. Simulating influence spread using Linear Threshold Model (LTM) or Independent Cascade Model (IC) to study diffusion dynamics by assigning thresholds/probabilities to nodes
